# Tauri Updater Setup Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **Version Comparison Logic**: Added proper semantic version comparison
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for 404, 403, and network errors
3. **Auto-update Logic**: Fixed auto-updater to respect version comparison
4. **UI Improvements**: Added "up-to-date" status and better progress display
5. **Progress Calculation**: Fixed download progress percentage calculation

## Current Status
✅ Updater plugin is enabled in `tauri.conf.json`
✅ Capabilities are configured for updater permissions  
✅ Version comparison logic implemented
✅ Error handling improved
✅ Auto-updater service fixed
✅ UI updated with better status messages

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Version Comparison
- Added semantic version comparison function
- App now correctly shows "up-to-date" when current version (1.1.1) is newer than available version (1.1.0)
- Prevents false update notifications

### 2. Error Handling
- 404 errors: "Update file not found. The release may not have the correct assets uploaded."
- 403 errors: "Access denied. Check if the release is public and not a draft."
- Network errors: "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again."

### 3. Progress Display
- Fixed download progress calculation using content length
- Better progress percentage display

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Generate New Signing Keys
The current public key in the config is from a different project. You need to generate your own:

```bash
# Generate new signing keys
pnpm tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/myapp.key

# This will create:
# - ~/.tauri/myapp.key (private key - KEEP SECRET!)
# - ~/.tauri/myapp.key.pub (public key - use in tauri.conf.json)
```

### 2. Update tauri.conf.json with Your Public Key
Replace the `pubkey` value in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with your generated public key.

### 3. Set Environment Variables for Building
Before building, set your private key:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="Path or content of your private key"
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=""  # if you set a password
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
export TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="Path or content of your private key"
export TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=""  # if you set a password
```

### 4. Build with Updater Artifacts
```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

This will create update artifacts in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/updater/`

### 5. Create GitHub Release
1. Go to your GitHub repository releases
2. Create a new release with version tag (e.g., `v1.1.2` - must be higher than current 1.1.1)
3. Upload the update artifacts from the build output
4. Upload the `latest.json` file (update version numbers and URLs to match your release)

### 6. Test the Updater
1. Build and run your app
2. Go to Settings page
3. Click "Check for Updates"
4. The updater should now work correctly

## Important Notes

- **Never share your private key** - it's used to sign updates
- **Keep your private key safe** - if you lose it, you can't update existing installations
- The `latest.json` file must be updated for each new release
- Update URLs in `latest.json` must match your actual release assets
- Version numbers in `latest.json` must be higher than the current app version
- **Draft releases are not accessible** - make sure releases are published, not drafts

## Current Behavior

With your current setup:
- Current app version: 1.1.1
- Latest release version: 1.1.0
- Result: App will show "You're up to date!" because 1.1.1 > 1.1.0

To test the updater:
1. Create a new release with version 1.1.2 or higher
2. Upload the correct assets
3. Update the `latest.json` file
4. The updater will then show an available update

## Troubleshooting

If updates still don't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the `latest.json` URL is accessible
3. Ensure version numbers are correct (newer than current)
4. Check that the public key matches your private key
5. Verify the update artifacts were created during build
6. Ensure the release is published (not draft)
7. Check that the asset URLs in `latest.json` match the actual uploaded files
