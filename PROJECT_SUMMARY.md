    - Shop management (CRUD, members, permissions)
    - Shared utilities (hooks, formatters, validators)
    - Barcode scanner
    - Error handling
    - UI components catalog
    - Custom components
    - Hooks reference
    - State management
    - Quick reference guide

- **`AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md`** - Quick reference for AI:
    - Package manager rules
    - Architecture overview
    - Code generation rules
    - Common tasks
    - Component reference
    - Performance patterns
    - Testing guidelines
    - Checklist for AI assistants

### 3. Project Structure

The project now has clear documentation for:

```

## Key Improvements

### For AI Assistants

1. **Clear Rules**: AI now knows to always use pnpm, follow feature-based architecture, and prioritize shadcn/ui components
2. **Responsive Design**: AI will always consider both desktop and mobile when generating UI
3. **Type Safety**: AI will generate proper TypeScript with no `any` types
4. **Consistent Patterns**: AI has access to proven patterns for common tasks
5. **Component Priority**: AI knows to use shadcn/ui first, then custom components

### For Developers

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All features, components, and patterns documented
2. **Quick Reference**: Easy-to-find examples and patterns
3. **Feature Development Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for adding features
4. **Best Practices**: Clear guidelines for code quality and consistency

### For the Project

1. **Maintainability**: Clear structure and patterns make code easier to maintain
2. **Scalability**: Feature-based architecture supports growth
3. **Consistency**: Rules ensure all code follows same patterns
4. **Quality**: Built-in best practices for performance, security, and accessibility

## How to Use

### For AI Assistants

AI assistants will automatically read rules from `.amazonq/rules/` and apply them when generating code. The rules ensure:

- Always use `pnpm` for package management
- Follow feature-based architecture
- Generate responsive UI (desktop & mobile)
- Use TypeScript with proper types
- Prioritize shadcn/ui components
- Follow established patterns

### For Developers

1. **Starting Development**: Read `README.md` for quick start
2. **Understanding Features**: Check `FEATURES.md` for complete feature list
3. **Adding Features**: Follow `feature-guide.md` in `.amazonq/rules/`
4. **Finding Patterns**: Reference `component-patterns.md` for common patterns
5. **Architecture Details**: Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for deep dive

### For New Team Members

1. Start with `README.md` - Project overview
2. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Understand structure
3. Review `FEATURES.md` - Learn available features
4. Check `.amazonq/rules/` - Understand coding standards
5. Follow `feature-guide.md` - Start building

## Technology Stack

## Package Manager

**ALWAYS use `pnpm`** - This is enforced in AI rules and documentation.

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm tauri dev        # Desktop development
pnpm tauri:android    # Android development
pnpm tauri:ios        # iOS development
```

## Next Steps

### For Continued Development

1. **Add New Features**: Follow the feature guide in `.amazonq/rules/feature-guide.md`
2. **Improve Documentation**: Keep docs updated as features are added
3. **Write Tests**: Add tests for new features
4. **Optimize Performance**: Use patterns from component-patterns.md
5. **Enhance UI**: Use shadcn/ui components for consistency

### For AI Integration

The AI rules are now in place. When working with AI assistants:

1. AI will automatically follow project rules
2. AI will generate responsive, type-safe code
3. AI will use established patterns
4. AI will prioritize shadcn/ui components
5. AI will always use pnpm
