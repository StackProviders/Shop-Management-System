# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX: Wrong Repository Configuration

## The Problem
Your `PUBLISH_REPO` secret is pointing to the **source repository** instead of the **publisher repository**.

**Current (WRONG)**: `StackProviders/Shop-Management-System`  
**Should be**: `StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher`

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Update the PUBLISH_REPO Secret
1. Go to `StackProviders/Shop-Management-System` repository
2. Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Find the `PUBLISH_REPO` secret
4. Click "Update" 
5. Change the value to: `StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher`
6. Click "Update secret"

### Step 2: Verify Your Token Has Access to Publisher Repository
Your fine-grained token must have access to **BOTH** repositories:
- âœ… `StackProviders/Shop-Management-System` (source)
- âœ… `StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher` (publisher)

### Step 3: Test the Fix
```bash
git tag v1.1.1 && git push origin v1.1.1
```

## Why This Happened
The workflow logs show:
```
Verifying access to repository: StackProviders/Shop-Management-System
```

But it should show:
```
Verifying access to repository: StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. âœ… Build completes in `StackProviders/Shop-Management-System`
2. âœ… Release is created in `StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher`
3. âœ… All artifacts are uploaded to the publisher repository
4. âœ… `latest.json` is generated for auto-updater

## Verification
After updating the secret, the workflow logs should show:
```
Verifying access to repository: StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher
```

This is a simple configuration fix - just update the `PUBLISH_REPO` secret value!
