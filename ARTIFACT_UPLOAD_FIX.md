# Artifact Upload Fix Guide

## The Problem
The workflow was creating releases and generating `latest.json`, but the actual built artifacts (MSI, DMG, AppImage, etc.) were not being uploaded to the release. Only the `latest.json` file was being uploaded.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Artifact Upload Step
- Added a new step that runs only on Ubuntu (to avoid duplicate uploads)
- Finds all built artifacts in `src-tauri/target/`
- Uploads each artifact to the release using GitHub API

### 2. Enhanced Artifact Detection
The workflow now looks for these file types:
- `*.msi` (Windows installer)
- `*.dmg` (macOS disk image)
- `*.AppImage` (Linux AppImage)
- `*.deb` (Debian package)
- `*.rpm` (Red Hat package)
- `*.tar.gz` (macOS app bundle)
- `*.app` (macOS application bundle)

### 3. Added Release Verification
- Added a step to verify that assets were uploaded successfully
- Shows total asset count in the release
- Confirms `latest.json` is present

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better logging to show which artifacts are found
- Clear error messages if artifacts are missing
- Verification step to confirm upload success

## How It Works Now

### Build Process:
1. **Build on all platforms** (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows)
2. **Create release** in publisher repository
3. **Upload artifacts** from Ubuntu runner (centralized upload)
4. **Generate latest.json** with correct download URLs
5. **Upload latest.json** to release
6. **Verify** all assets are present

### Expected Artifacts:
After a successful build, you should see these files in the release:
- `Shop Management System_1.1.0_x64_en-US.msi` (Windows 64-bit)
- `Shop Management System_1.1.0_x86_en-US.msi` (Windows 32-bit)
- `Shop Management System_1.1.0_x64.dmg` (macOS Intel)
- `Shop Management System_1.1.0_aarch64.dmg` (macOS Apple Silicon)
- `Shop Management System_1.1.0_amd64.AppImage` (Linux 64-bit)
- `Shop Management System_1.1.0_i386.AppImage` (Linux 32-bit)
- `latest.json` (Auto-updater configuration)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Create a new tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.1.1 && git push origin v1.1.1
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab in `StackProviders/Shop-Management-System`
   - Watch the "publish" workflow
   - Check the "Upload artifacts to release" step
   - Check the "Verify release assets" step

3. **Verify the release**:
   - Go to `StackProviders/Shop-Management-App-Publisher` releases
   - Check that all platform artifacts are present
   - Verify `latest.json` is uploaded

## Troubleshooting

### If artifacts are still missing:
1. **Check the "Upload artifacts to release" step** - Look for error messages
2. **Verify artifact paths** - The step shows which files it finds
3. **Check permissions** - Ensure the token has upload permissions
4. **Check file sizes** - Large files might timeout

### If latest.json is missing:
1. **Check the "Upload latest.json to existing release" step**
2. **Verify the file exists** - The step should show if latest.json was found
3. **Check the "Verify release assets" step** - It will confirm if latest.json is present

### Common Issues:
- **File not found**: Check if the build actually created the expected artifacts
- **Upload timeout**: Large files might need more time to upload
- **Permission denied**: Verify the token has the correct permissions
- **Duplicate uploads**: The workflow only uploads from Ubuntu to avoid duplicates

## Expected Success Behavior

After the fix, you should see:
1. ✅ All platform artifacts uploaded to the release
2. ✅ `latest.json` uploaded with correct download URLs
3. ✅ Verification step shows all assets are present
4. ✅ Auto-updater can download the correct files for each platform

The key improvement is that now ALL built artifacts are properly uploaded to the release, not just the `latest.json` file.
